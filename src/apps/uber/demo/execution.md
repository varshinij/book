We completely reworked the appearence of the application including unified nav bars, new images, better color schemes, and icons representing all types of users. We even discovered the componentDidMount() function in React which calls any javascript code inside only after components have been successfully added to the DOM. This allowed us to get some of the animations in Materialize like collapsibles and tabs to work with React. Additionally, users may now login using GitHub or Facebook.

While we struggled with completing a User Profile feature, we made significant progress and simply ran out of time with the Friday deadline to deploy a bug-free version for the demo. We tried to give users the ability to rank currently existing chefs and dynamically append a form to the page to do so, but this was difficult to figure out with React. We were also able to get the form to post to our firebase, but at some point this broke and we were unable to determine the cause.
