# Proposal

## Team Members

Varshini Jagannath,
Yadira Valadez

## Ideation

These ideation questions are the same as before. Your answers should represent
the integration of creative ideas from every team member.


* What is the name of your app?

Critique

* What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?

People can use this application for discussing about books. The application allows you to create your own profile and add books that you want to talk about. If you can’t find the book you are looking for then you can add a book and provide information about the book. This is more than a discussion forum because you can also recommend books to users based on their interests. The books will be linked to amazon or goodreads in case people want to buy the book or know more about it. The books are classified based on their genres. The search functionality allows you to search based on the title or author of the book. You could also view all the books under a genre and decide which book to discuss about.

* What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?

Since it might become too clustered if there are too many people conversing on the same book, the ideal number of concurrent users will be 25.

* What skills do people need in order to do this activity?

people don’t require any specific skills they just need to enjoy reading books!

* Is this activity for fun or for something practical?

This activity is for fun because it connects people from all over the world and helps them bond over books.

* How can a person see what everyone else is doing?

There will be an info icon and when you click on it you get to view the current users with their status information like last time they were present, number of comments, number of views. People can also star comments in the discussion forum and you can view who has starred the comments

* How can a person see the most recent result of everyone's collaborative effort?

The info tab gives you details on who is currently online. In the chat itself you can see the profile photo of the participants and when you hover over them you can see their name. When you click on their photo you are directed to their profile page which shows their recent activity like books they added or commented about.

* What can an admin see (i.e., God's mode)?

There is no admin in the application. Everyone can see everything.

## Contributions

For each person on the team, jot down a list of ideas credited to that person.
It's okay to credit multiple people for the same idea. The rationale of this
section of the proposal is to demonstrate that everyone on the team contributes
useful ideas.

* Varshini Jagannath
  * Info tab for viewing others activity
  * Profile page for users to view recent activity and change personal 
  * Genre based classification
information
* Yadira Valadez
  * Search options and add button for books
  * Starring comments
  * Info tab

## Plan

A reasonable way to implement a functional prototype of your together app
is to build upon the service-matching app (i.e. uber). Discuss what additional
efforts may be required from your team to develop the together app.

* What existing components of the uber app your team can reuse?

We can reuse the functionality of users current status based on which some activity will be performed.

* What new components and features your team may need to build?

Status of users, Dedicated Profile page for all users (personal and public version), Search optimizations, Presenting data based on Genres.

* What new skills your team will still need to acquire?

Implementing Chat in real time, getting updated status information, allowing users to edit their profile information, search by different categories 

## What's Next?

This is a preliminary proposal. Next week, your team will receive feedback and
will work on building a _mockup_ of this app. The week after that, your team
will start implementing the app.
